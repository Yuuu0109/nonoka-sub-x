"""What Finoka's FineSub engine patch is allowed to be.

The cloud runs one task across three containers and only the Whisper leg needs
the GPU, so ``patches/finesub/0001-split-vad-prefix-and-qwen-pass.patch`` makes
the VAD prefix and the Qwen pass separately runnable. Everything else about the
cloud is upstream code called with upstream arguments, and the value of that
claim is exactly the value of this file: it pins the seams the cloud depends on
*and* pins the patch to being additive, so nothing local can change underneath
a caller that never opts in.

That claim is about ``src/finesub`` -- the engine both sides import. A patch
confined to ``src/finesub_bootstrap`` fixes how *this machine* installs the
engine (the container installs nothing at run time), so it cannot make the two
sides compute anything different, and the stack is allowed to carry those.
